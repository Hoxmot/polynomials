# Polynomialns
## Wielomiany

My school project done on 1st year of studies. The biggest part of it is a library which handles operation on sparse higher-order polynomials. It consists of three parts, each one uses the previous.

It has been done mostly in Polish.

I think this project is very important to me, since it was my first experience with memory management. When I was writing the first part of it, I didn't know how it worked. I was using `malloc()`, `calloc()`, and `free()` randomly just hoping it would work. It appeared it didn't, so I had to correct the exercise during summer break. I think I ended up solving part 1 and 2, but I don't remember quite well. I don't won't to look at the code again (it's porbably ugly AF, since I was pretty bad at programming back then).

What's more, it's also my first experience with git. The beginning of the graph is quite funny (I think it looks like a car, but maybe you have any other ideas). Additionally, we weren't using github for it, but our own server, so it was an additional obstacle.

Good old times...
